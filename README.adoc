= Anki Set Randomizer

Anki Multiple Choice is an add-on that allows you
to define randomized sets of elements.

It is not a note type, but rather a general syntax addition, that
can be used on *all note types*. It works on all platforms, that
*Anki Persistence* supports, which AnkiDesktop, AnkiWeb, AnkiDroid, and
AnkiMobile.

Its use cases include:

* Differentiation cards
* Multiple Choice cards
* Assign categories cards
* Make associations cards
* A special form of clozes, which I dubbed "SR Clozes"

All of these use cases can be inspected, if you download the sample deck and
look through its cards. Its the best next thing to a tutorial I can offer right
now.
