= Generators

Generators are the meta elements that are first evaluated in SR. Generators
include the following three commands:

. *value sets*
. *picking values*, with `pick()`
. *evaluating value sets*, with `eval()`

toc::[]

== Value sets

Generators sets are a way of defining text elements without automatically
displaying them.

If you define inline elements, like e.g.  `[[alligator::bear:cat]`,
you often have to copy, move, or delete in order to achieve what you want.
If you utilize generators sets, you have more control
over where you want them the text elements to appear in the first place.
