= Inheritance

* inherit as little as possible,

`.shuffles` and `generatedValues`
* are inherited relatively
** if there is a structure match, the newer version should be inherited, the older version omitted

.`uniqueConstraints` and `orders`
* are inherited absolutely
** no `iter`, or `name` required
** modified during main2()
