      4.03. Second randomization <br>

      Let's have the same question, as before, but show the answer in-place: <br>

      Example: Connect countries with their respective capitals: <br>

      Countries: [[$o(a)::$n!()::Italy::Ethiopia::India::New Zealand::Germany]] <br>
      Capitals:  [[$o(a)::$n!()::Rome::Addis Ababa::New Delhi::Wellington::Berlin]] <br>

      Or in list view: <br>

      [[$n(y)::$o(b, y)::Italy]]: [[$n!(z)::$o(b, z)::Rome]] <br>
      [[$n(y)::Ethiopia]]:         [[$n(z)::Addis Ababa]] <br>
      [[$n(y)::India]]:            [[$n(z)::New Delhi]] <br>
      [[$n(y)::New Zealand]]:      [[$n(z)::Wellington]] <br>
      [[$n(y)::Germany]]:          [[$n(z)::Berlin]] <br>

      <br>

      [[$o!(a)::$o!(b)]] Look at the backside and be amazed how conveniently short this is. <br>

      "$order!(a)" defines order sharing after the second randomization. I'll try to explain it succinctly: <br>
      * While uncovering the frontside, you have two order-sharing sets, which are matched. <br>
      * However before you even get to the see the frontside, the second randomization will kick in, and mix up the countries again. <br>
      * Uncovering the backside will reveal a set which enables this in the second randomization set, which is why it the elements are automatically sorted. <br>

      The same can also work in reverse. You'd need a field that only appears on the front: <br>
      * This field contains the meta-element, to perform a second randomization of the capitals. <br>
      * The backside of the card misses this field. Thus the capitals are not randomized a second time, and still fit the countries! <br>
