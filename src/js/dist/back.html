      1.09 Generators: Evaluations <br>

      You cannot only pick from value sets, but you can also evaluate value sets themselves. At this point it behaves more like Clozes. <br>
      The name of the meta element is "$evaluate(count, valueset, uniqueness_constraint)". "evaluate" can be shortenend to "eval", or just "e". Both arguments, "count", and "uniqueness_constraint", are optional. <br>

      Example: What's the capital of Germany: [[$c1:Berlin:starts with B::$eval(c1:1)]] <br>

      As you can see, it now shows the hint. Now try reversing... <br>

      <hr>

      And now, it shows the answer: [[$eval(c1:0)]]! <br>

      So in short, the evaluations are like reversed picks: instead of generating the element where the pick element used to be, it generates the element where the value set used to be! <br>

      And just like picks, evaluations also supports wildcards, counts, and uniqueness constraints: <br>

      [[$gr|alpha|beta|gamma|delta::$eval(4, gr:*, uc)]] <br>
